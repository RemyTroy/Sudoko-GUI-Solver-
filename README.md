# Sudoko-GUI-Solver-

**Sudoku:**
Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as boxes) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. Sudoku puzzles come in various difficulty levels and require a combination of logical deduction and elimination strategies to solve.
